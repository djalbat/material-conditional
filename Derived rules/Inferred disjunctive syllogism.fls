Rule (InferredDisjunctionElimination)
  Premises
    P => R
    Q => R
    P \/ Q
  Conclusion
    R
  Proof
    P -> R by LogicalConsequenceInfersMaterialConditional
    ¬P \/ R by StrongerMaterialConditionalElimination
    R \/ ¬P by DisjunctionCommutes
    Q -> R by LogicalConsequenceInfersMaterialConditional
    ¬Q \/ R by StrongerMaterialConditionalElimination
    R \/ ¬Q by DisjunctionCommutes
    (R \/ ¬P) /\ (R \/ ¬Q) by ConjunctionIntroduction
    R \/ (¬P /\ ¬Q) by DisjunctionDistributedOverConjunction
    ¬(¬P /\ ¬Q) by DisjunctionInfersNegatedConjunctionOfNegations
    (¬P /\ ¬Q) \/ R by DisjunctionCommutes
  Therefore
    R by DisjunctiveSyllogism
