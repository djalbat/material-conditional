Rule (InferredDisjunctionElimination)
  Premises
    P => R
    Q => R
    P ∨ Q
  Conclusion
    R
  Proof
    P => R
    Q => R
    P -> R by LogicalConsequenceInfersMaterialConditional
    Q -> R by LogicalConsequenceInfersMaterialConditional
    ¬P ∨ R by StrongerMaterialConditionalElimination
    ¬Q ∨ R by StrongerMaterialConditionalElimination
    (¬P ∨ R) ∧ (¬Q ∨ R) by ConjunctionIntroduction
    (¬P ∧ ¬Q) ∨ R
    P ∨ Q
    ¬(¬P ∧ ¬Q) by DisjunctionInfersNegatedConjunctionOfNegations
    (¬P ∧ ¬Q) ∨ R
    ¬(¬P ∧ ¬Q)
  Therefore
    R by DisjunctiveSyllogism
